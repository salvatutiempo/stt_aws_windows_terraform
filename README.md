# Description

Have you ever been interested in implementing multiple resources in the Cloud using just some lines of code? Or a way to control hundreds of servers and destroy them in a breath? 

Let's talk about Terraform, a tool that can generate an infrastructure through a declarative language. 

And let's learn it the best way: Creating a Windows EC2 Instance in AWS that we can connect through RDP, and all of that in some lines of code!

# Prerrequisites

For this lab we will need:
-	An AWS account that has been previously created 
-	Administrator permissions on the computer
